# Life-Sim

**Life-Sim** is a modular, extensible life simulation engine built in Python. It simulates the biological, economic, and social trajectory of a single agent within a deterministic, configuration-driven world. The project emphasizes statistical realism, emergent behavior, and strict separation of concerns between simulation logic and visualization.

## 🚀 Current Features (MVP 0.5)

### Core Simulation & Architecture
*   **Deterministic Simulation Loop:**
    *   **Master Seed:** The entire simulation (Python `random`, `numpy.random`) is initialized via a single integer seed defined in `config.json`, ensuring 100% reproducibility for debugging and sharing runs.
    *   **Turn-Based Logic:** The simulation advances in **1-month increments** (`process_turn`).
        *   **Date Tracking:** The system now tracks the specific Month and Year (starting Jan 2025), allowing for seasonal events and precise timeline management.
        *   **Age Calculation:** Age is stored as `age_months`. The "Age X" log headers are triggered specifically on the agent's birth month, decoupling biological age from the calendar year.
    *   **Event Logging:** A dual-channel logging system writes runtime events to both the console (stdout) and rotating log files (`logs/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`) with the format `Time | Level | Module | Message`.
*   **Dynamic Action Point (AP) System:**
    *   **The "Typical Day" Abstraction:**
        *   **Resource Model:** Time is modeled as a finite resource of **24.0 Action Points (AP)** per turn, representing the agent's "Average Daily Routine" for that month. 1.0 AP equates to 1 hour of daily activity.
        *   **Turn Reset:** At the start of every month (`process_turn`), the AP budget is fully reset, allowing for fresh allocation based on the agent's current life stage.
    *   **Configuration-Driven Biology:**
        *   **`time_management` Config:** Sleep requirements are not hardcoded. They are defined in `config.json` via age brackets (e.g., `Infant: 14h`, `Child: 10h`, `Teen: 9h`, `Adult: 8h`).
        *   **Dynamic Recalculation:** Upon every birthday, the agent's `_recalculate_ap_needs()` method queries the config to adjust their **Maintenance AP** (Sleep), automatically unlocking more "Free Time" as they grow from infancy to adulthood.
    *   **State Management:**
        *   **Locked AP:** Reserved for mandatory obligations (School, Work).
        *   **Maintenance AP:** Reserved for biological needs (Sleep).
        *   **Free AP:** The calculated remainder (`24.0 - Locked - Maintenance - Used`) available for player agency.
    *   **Visual Dashboard (`APBar` Widget):**
        *   **24-Segment Grid:** A dedicated UI element in the Left Panel visualizes the 24-hour day as distinct blocks.
        *   **Color-Coded Allocation:**
            *   **Blue (Right-Aligned):** Sleep/Maintenance hours.
            *   **Red (Left-Aligned):** Locked obligations (School/Work).
            *   **Gray:** Time already spent on voluntary actions.
            *   **Green:** The remaining "Free" budget available for gameplay.
        *   **Feedback:** A text label dynamically updates to show exact availability (e.g., *"Time: 7.0h Free / 9.0h Sleep"*).
*   **Configuration-Driven Design:**
    *   **No Magic Numbers:** All gameplay variables (initial stats, costs, salary multipliers) are loaded from `config.json`.
    *   **Static Constants:** Visualization settings (Screen Size, Colors, FPS) and Time settings (Start Year, Month Names) are decoupled in `constants.py`.
*   **Multi-Agent Architecture:**
    *   **Unified Entity Model:** The `Agent` class supports both the **Player** and **NPCs** (Non-Player Characters). All agents share the same biological DNA (Attributes, Health, Inventory), distinguished only by an `is_player` flag and unique UUIDs.
    *   **Full Fidelity Simulation (Unified Loop):** The "Truman Show" optimization has been removed in favor of total simulation parity. NPCs now process the exact same biological, economic, and time-management logic as the Player every month.
        *   **Shared Economy:** NPCs earn monthly salaries, accumulate wealth, and pay costs exactly like the player.
        *   **Automated Routine:** NPCs possess a simulated Action Point (AP) budget. A passive routine automatically "spends" their AP on mandatory obligations (Work, School, Sleep) to maintain a valid state for future AI decision-making.
    *   **Desynchronized Aging:** NPCs are initialized with randomized birth months (0-11 offset) to ensure biological updates occur naturally throughout the year rather than synchronizing perfectly with the player's birthday.

### Identity & Biology
*   **Procedural Generation & Genetics:**
    *   **Lineage System:** Distinguishes between **Lineage Heads** (First Generation, procedurally generated) and **Descendants** (Next Generation, inherited traits).
    *   **Bio-Data:** Agents are initialized with a First Name, Last Name, Gender, Country, and City. Descendants inherit Last Name, City, and Country from parents.
    *   **Appearance Inheritance:**
        *   **Pigmentation:** Skin Tone is calculated by blending parental values with slight variance. Eye and Hair colors use probabilistic inheritance (45% Father, 45% Mother, 10% Mutation).
    *   **Procedural Family Generation:**
        *   **Algorithm:** Implements a "Backwards Age, Forwards Genetics" approach.
            *   *Age Calculation:* Ages are determined top-down starting from the Player (Age 0) -> Parents -> Grandparents using a **Gaussian Distribution** (Mean 28, SD 6) clamped to reproductive limits (16-45). This ensures realistic generational gaps.
            *   *Entity Instantiation:* Agents are created bottom-up (Grandparents -> Parents -> Player) to ensure valid genetic inheritance references exist at instantiation.
        *   **Psychometric Natural Affinity System ("Affinity as Gravity"):**
            *   **Deterministic Architecture:** Randomness (RNG) has been completely removed from relationship generation. Relationships are now strictly deterministic based on Seed and Personality.
            *   **The Gravity Model:** Relationships are modeled as `Total_Score = Base_Affinity + Sum(Active_Modifiers)`.
                *   **Base Affinity:** The permanent, immutable "pull" between two personalities. If two agents are incompatible, their relationship will naturally drift toward hatred unless maintained by active modifiers.
                *   **Active Modifiers:** Contextual buffs/debuffs that temporarily or permanently alter the score.
            *   **Doubled Psychometric Weights:** The impact of personality has been doubled to ensure character traits matter more than generic family roles.
                *   **Actor Effects:** Neuroticism and Agreeableness now apply a **1.0x** weighted penalty/bonus (previously 0.5x). A highly neurotic parent is now a significant source of family stress.
                *   **Dyadic Effects:** Value Clashes (Openness) and Lifestyle Clashes (Conscientiousness) now apply a **0.5x** weighted penalty (previously 0.25x).
        *   **Expanded Relationship Range:** The social data model supports a range of **`-100` to `+100`**.
        *   **Structural Modifiers (The "Bond" System):**
            *   Instead of arbitrary "Base Values," relationships are initialized with specific **Structural Modifiers** that represent social contracts.
            *   **Maternal/Paternal Bond:** **+80** (Permanent). This massive buffer allows parents to love even "difficult" children, though extreme personality clashes can still drag the total score down over time.
            *   **Marriage Bond:** **+60** (Permanent). Represents the commitment of marriage.
            *   **Sibling Bond:** **+30** (Permanent).
            *   **Civil/In-Law:** **+10** (Permanent).
        *   **Extended Family & In-Law Topology:**
            *   **The Grandparent Bridge:** Paternal and Maternal sides of the family are now linked. Grandparents have "In-Law" relationships with their counterparts.
            *   **Marriage-Driven Sentiment:** The starting score for Grandparent-In-Laws is calculated as `Civil_Base (+10) + (Parent_Marriage_Score * 0.5)`. If the parents have a toxic marriage, the extended family network naturally fractures as grandparents "take sides."
            *   **Siblings-in-Law:** Aunts and Uncles are automatically linked to their siblings' spouses (In-Laws) using the affinity engine.
    *   **Anthropometry & Growth:**
        *   **Height Inheritance:**
            *   *Lineage Heads:* Generated via Gaussian distribution (Male: 176cm/7SD, Female: 163cm/6SD).
            *   *Descendants:* Implements the **Mid-Parental Height Formula**: `(Father + Mother +/- 13) / 2`. A Gaussian variance (SD 5cm) is applied to simulate regression to the mean.
        *   **Dynamic Growth:** Agents are born at ~50cm. Growth is simulated stochastically (20% chance per month to gain 1cm) towards their `genetic_height_potential` until **Age 20**.
        *   **Senescence Shrinkage:** After **Age 60**, agents have a 3% monthly chance to lose 1cm of height due to spinal compression.
        *   **Physique (LBMI Model):** Weight is strictly derived, not random.
            *   **Lean Body Mass Index (LBMI):** Calculated as `Base_LBMI (M:18/F:15) + (Athleticism * 0.06)`.
            *   **Body Fat %:** Calculated as `Base_BF (M:25/F:35) - (Athleticism * 0.18) + Variance`.
            *   **Mass Calculation:** `Total Weight = (LBMI * Height²) / (1 - BodyFat%)`. This ensures high-athleticism agents are heavier due to muscle, not fat.
*   **Universal Attribute System:**
    *   **IQ:** Replaces "Smarts" with a Gaussian distribution (Mean 100, SD 15).
    *   **Attributes (0-100 Scale):**
        *   **Physical:** Strength, Athleticism, Endurance.
    *   **Hormonal Curves (Genotype vs. Phenotype):**
        *   **Genotype:** Agents are born with a hidden `_genetic_peak` (0-100) for Fertility and Libido.
        *   **Phenotype:** The expressed value is recalculated annually via `_recalculate_hormones()`:
            *   *Puberty (12-18):* Linear ramp-up from 0% to 100% of genetic peak.
            *   *Female Fertility:* Prime (15-30), Decline (30-45), Menopause (45-50), Sterile (50+).
            *   *Male Fertility:* Prime (18-40), followed by slow linear decay (never reaching 0).
            *   *Libido:* Spikes during "Hormonal Storm" (13-18), plateaus until 35, then decays by 1.5% annually.
    *   **Personality (Big Five Model):** A deep psychological simulation based on the OCEAN model.
        *   **Structure:** 5 Main Traits, each composed of 6 specific sub-facets.
        *   **Scoring:** Facets range from 0-20; Main Traits range from 0-120.
        *   **Visualization:** The Attribute Modal displays the full psychometric profile with color-coded values (Green for high positive traits, Red for high negative traits like Neuroticism).
        *   **1. Openness to Experience:** Appreciation for art, emotion, adventure, and unusual ideas.
            *   *Fantasy:* Having a vivid imagination and an active dream life.

        *   **3. Extraversion:** Energy, positive emotions, surgency, and the tendency to seek stimulation in the company of others.
            *   *Warmth:* Interest in and friendliness towards others; ease of forming attachments.
            *   *Gregariousness:* Preference for the company of others; enjoying crowds and social stimulation.
            *   *Assertiveness:* Social dominance; forcefulness of expression and leadership ability.
            *   *Activity:* Pace of living; level of energy and busyness.
            *   *Excitement-Seeking:* Need for environmental stimulation, thrills, and risk.
            *   *Positive Emotions:* Tendency to experience happiness, joy, excitement, and optimism.
        *   **4. Agreeableness:** Tendency to be compassionate and cooperative rather than suspicious and antagonistic.
            *   *Trust:* Belief in the sincerity and good intentions of others.
            *   *Straightforwardness:* Frankness, sincerity, and ingenuity (avoiding manipulation).
            *   *Altruism:* Active concern for the welfare of others; generosity and willingness to help.
            *   *Compliance:* Response to interpersonal conflict; tendency to defer to others rather than compete.
            *   *Modesty:* Tendency to play down one's own achievements and be humble.
            *   *Tender-Mindedness:* Attitude of sympathy and concern for others; governed by emotion rather than cold logic.
        *   **5. Neuroticism:** Tendency to experience negative emotions like anger, anxiety, or depression.

    *   **Hidden:** Karma, Luck, Sexuality (Hetero/Homo/Bi).
*   **Derived Metrics (Physiology):**
    *   **Body Fat %:** Calculated dynamically based on Gender and Athleticism.
        *   *Formula:* `Base_BF (M:25/F:35) - (Athleticism% * 18) + Random_Variance(-3 to +5)`.
        *   *Constraint:* Minimum 4.0%.
    *   **Lean Mass:** Calculated dynamically (`LBMI * Height²`).
    *   **BMI:** Automatically calculated to track physical condition.
*   **Aging & Mortality:**
    *   **The "Prime of Life" Curve:** `max_health` is not static.
        *   *Childhood (0-20):* Capacity grows linearly from 70 to 100.
        *   *Prime (20-50):* Capacity peaks at 100.
        *   *Senescence (50+):* Capacity decays quadratically ($100 - (age-50)^2/25$), hitting 0 at age 100.
    *   **Death Condition:** If Health drops to $\le 0$, the `is_alive` flag is set to `False`, and further actions are blocked.
    *   **Natural Entropy:** NPCs over age 50 experience slight random health decay **monthly**, creating a high-mortality window that ensures natural death occurs variably rather than strictly at the mathematical cap.

### Economy & Career
*   **Job Market:**
    *   **Data Structure:** Jobs are defined in `config.json` with a `title` and `salary`.
    *   **Application Logic:** The "Find Job" action picks a random job from the pool. Success is currently guaranteed (requirements removed for IQ refactor).
    *   **Age Restriction:** Agents cannot apply for jobs until **Age 16**.
    *   **Income:** Salaries are distributed monthly (`Salary / 12`) during the `process_turn` phase, simulating realistic cash flow.
    *   **NPC Savings Initialization:** Upon generation, adult NPCs are assigned a starting cash balance calculated as `10% of Salary * Years Worked (Age - 18)`, simulating prior life savings.
*   **Active Income (Overtime):**
    *   **Mechanic:** Employed agents can manually "Work Overtime."
    *   **Reward:** Immediate cash bonus equal to **1%** of the annual salary.
    *   **Constraint:** Action is blocked if the agent is unemployed.

### Education System
*   **Configurable Framework:**
    *   **Systems:** Supports defining custom school structures in `config.json`.
    *   **Default:** Implements the **British International** system (Nursery through Year 13/IB) as the default.
*   **Academic Calendar:**
    *   **Timeline:** School runs independently of biological age, operating on a **September to June** cycle.
    *   **Status:** Tracks "In Session" vs. "Summer Break" states.
*   **Progression:**
    *   **Immediate Enrollment:** Agents are automatically enrolled in the appropriate grade level immediately upon generation.
    *   **Player-Centric Logging:** While all NPCs simulate school performance and grade advancement in the background, the Event Log now only displays school notifications (Enrollment, Summer Break, Graduation) for the **Player**, reducing log noise.
    *   **Performance (Random Walk):** Academic performance (0-100) currently uses a random drift algorithm (+/- 2 per month).
    *   **Pass/Fail Logic:**
        *   *Threshold:* Performance must be **> 20** to pass a grade.
        *   *Failure:* Results in repeating the year and a **-20 Happiness** penalty.
        *   *Graduation:* Completing the final year (Year 13) awards a **+20 Happiness** boost and removes the "School" status.

### Actions & Progression
*   **Healthcare (Doctor):**
    *   **Cost:** Flat fee of **$100**.
    *   **Effect:** Restores Health by a random value of **10 to 20** (clamped to the current `max_health`).
    *   **Constraints:** Action fails if `Agent.money < 100`.
*   **Toggle Attributes:**
    *   A UI-only action that pauses the log view to inspect the full list of 15+ agent attributes (Identity, Physical, Personality, Skills).

### User Interface & Visualization
*   **Technical Specs:**
    *   **Resolution:** Fixed **1920x1080** window.
    *   **Framerate:** Capped at 60 FPS.
    *   **Theme:** Dark Mode (Background: RGB 20,20,20; Panels: RGB 40,40,40).
*   **Three-Panel Layout:**
    *   **Left Panel (300px):** Real-time dashboard showing Name, Age (Years + Months), Current Date (Month/Year), Money, Job, Vitals (Health/Happiness/IQ/Looks), and Physical Energy.
    *   **Center Panel (Variable):**
        *   **Advanced Narrative Engine:** The `SimState` initialization logic synthesizes Weather, City Atmosphere, Household Wealth, and Parental Personality (Big 5) to generate a unique, cohesive opening paragraph.
            *   **Context Awareness:** Accounts for specific scenarios like "Teen Mom," "Old Father," or "Neurotic Parents."
            *   **Grandparent Presence:** The engine now checks the relationship status of all four grandparents. It dynamically generates flavor text describing their presence (e.g., *"Your maternal grandfather is handing out cigars"*) or their absence/tension (e.g., *"Your paternal grandmother is present but refuses to look at your mother"*) based on their relationships with your parents.
        *   **LogPanel Widget:**
            *   **Smart Wrapping:** Text is dynamically wrapped based on font size and panel width.
            *   **Collapsible History:** The log is structured hierarchically. Clicking year headers (e.g., `[-] Age 5`) toggles the `expanded` state in the history buffer, hiding/showing events for that year.
        *   **Attribute Modal:**
            *   **Detailed Columns:** Renders 4 columns: Vitals/Physical, Openness/Conscientiousness, Extraversion/Agreeableness, and Neuroticism.
            *   **Economic Visibility:** The **Vitals** column now includes **Money** for all agents, allowing the player to verify the economic progress of NPCs (parents saving money, siblings earning wages).
            *   **Pinning System:** Clicking any attribute card toggles it into the **Pinned Attributes** list on the Left Panel (Dashboard), allowing players to track specific stats (e.g., "Fitness") without reopening the modal.
            *   **Visual Feedback:** Neuroticism traits use inverted color logic (High = Red, Low = Green), while positive traits use standard logic.
        *   **Interactive Family Tree (Modal):**
            *   **Topology:** Uses a **Layered Graph** approach with **Virtual Marriage Hubs** to handle complex relations (half-siblings, in-laws).
            *   **Layout Algorithm:**
                1.  **Harvest:** BFS traversal from the focus agent to find all relatives.
                2.  **Rank:** Assigns generations relative to the focus (Parents = +1, Children = -1).
                3.  **Ordering:** Uses **Ancestry-Based Sorting** to keep family units (spouses and children) vertically aligned under their grandparents.
                4.  **Relaxation:** Runs 5 iterations of a force-directed sweep (Down/Up) to center parents over children and resolve collisions.
            *   **Rendering:** Draws **Orthogonal Edges** (Manhattan geometry). Spousal links connect bottom-to-center; Parent-Child links use a "Bus" style routing.
            *   **Visual Distinction:** Nodes feature dynamic borders to distinguish relationships: **Solid Borders** indicate blood relatives (sharing a common ancestor), while **Dashed Borders** indicate in-laws or spouses.
            *   **Controls:**
                *   **Left-Drag:** Pan the view (infinite canvas).
                *   **Left-Click:** Refocus the tree on the clicked relative.
                *   **Right-Click:** Close tree and open the **Attribute Modal** for the clicked relative.
        *   **Interactive Social Map (Modal):**
            *   **Advanced Physics Engine:** A real-time **Force-Directed Graph** simulation using NumPy with dynamic force scaling.
                *   **Attraction Scaling:** The spring force between nodes is weighted by relationship strength. A relationship of 100 exerts **2x the attraction force** of a neutral (0) relationship, causing close-knit families and spouses to snap together into tight clusters.
                *   **Hostile Repulsion:** Negative relationships (Enemies) act as active repulsors. The engine transforms the spring force into a repulsive force, ensuring that rivals and enemies actively push away from each other on the canvas.
            *   **Network Visualization:**
                *   **Nodes:** Represent agents. The Player is distinct (White), while NPCs are color-coded by their relationship to the player (Green=Friend, Red=Enemy, Gray=Stranger).
                *   **Edges:** Dynamic lines representing relationships. **Thickness** indicates intensity (magnitude of the score), and **Color** uses linear interpolation between Gray (Neutral), Bright Green (Best Friend), and Deep Red (Nemesis).
            *   **Filters & Controls:**
                *   **Population Toggle:** Switch between "Show Known" (Player's immediate circle) and "Show All" (The entire simulation population).
                *   **Network Toggle:** Switch between "Direct Links" (Only Player connections) and "All Links" (Visualizing the complete web of NPC-NPC relationships).
            *   **Interactivity:**
                *   **Physics Interaction:** Users can drag nodes to fling them around the canvas; the physics engine reacts elastically.
                *   **Navigation:** Infinite canvas panning via background drag.
                *   **Rich Node Tooltips:** Hovering over a node displays a detailed overlay with Name, Age, Job, and precise Relationship stats.
                *   **Interactive Edge Highlighting:** Hovering over a relationship line visually highlights it (glows bright yellow and thickens), making it easy to select specific connections in a dense social web.
                *   **Detailed Edge Tooltips (The "Math of Love"):** Hovering over the connection line between any two agents reveals the full mathematical breakdown of their relationship:
                    *   **Base Affinity:** Displays the raw psychometric score, explicitly listing factors like *"Value Clash (Openness): -12.5"* or *"Neuroticism Penalty: -5.0"*.
                    *   **Active Modifiers:** Lists all currently active buffs/debuffs (e.g., *"Maternal Bond: +80.0"*), allowing the player to see exactly why a relationship exists.
    *   **Right Panel (300px):**
        *   **Tabbed Navigation:** Actions are organized into switchable categories (**Main**, **Social**, **Assets**).
        *   **Dynamic Visibility:** Buttons appear/disappear based on context (e.g., "Find Job" hidden <16, "Work Overtime" hidden if unemployed).
        *   **Auto-Layout:** The interface automatically restacks buttons to fill gaps when items are hidden.
        *   **Social Dashboard:** The Social Tab now features a **Relationship List**.
        *   **Bi-directional Relationship Bars:** UI cards now feature a center-aligned bar.
            *   **Positive:** Fills **Green to the right** (0 to 100).
            *   **Negative:** Fills **Red to the left** (0 to -100).
            *   **Visual Feedback:** This provides immediate visual identification of social standing, distinguishing between a "strained" relationship (short red bar) and a "nemesis" (full red bar).
        *   **Interactive Cards:** Each relationship card includes "Attributes" (to view the NPC's stats), a **Family Tree Icon** (graphical button), and "Interact" buttons.
        *   **Styling:** Buttons feature rounded corners and hover-responsive darkening (RGB 80,80,80). The primary action button is now labeled "Age Up (+1 Month)".

## 🗺️ Roadmap (Planned Features)

The following features should be implimented ASAP:

*   Add more flavor in birth, specifically whether the GPs are present based on their relationships.
*   Give player ability to also highlight the connection between two agents and see tooltip showing information related to whats affecting the relationship between the two agents.
*   Do a check to see if there is anything in the README which doesnt reflect the current codebase, or if there is anything in the codebase which isnt reflected in the readme.

The following features are planned to expand the simulation depth into a comprehensive life emulator:

### Core Mechanics: Dynamic Action Point (AP) System
*   **Concept: "The Typical Day":**
    *   **Resource:** A budget of **24.0 Action Points (AP)** per turn, representing the "Average Daily Routine" for that month.
    *   **Granularity:** Supports fractional costs (e.g., 0.5 AP) for micro-tasks.
*   **The Three Buckets:**
    *   **Locked AP (Obligations):** Automatically deducted for School (e.g., 7 AP), Job (8 AP), and Commute.
    *   **Maintenance AP (Biology):** Reserved for Sleep (e.g., 8-14 AP depending on age).
    *   **Free AP:** The remaining balance available for player actions (`24 - Locked - Maintenance`).
*   **"Rule Breaking" (Reclaiming AP):**
    *   **Truancy:** Option to "Skip School/Work" to refund Locked AP into Free AP. *Risk:* Truancy events, grade drops, firing.
    *   **Sleep Deprivation:** Option to "Stay Up Late" (reduce Maintenance AP). *Consequence:* Cumulative Health/Stress penalties if below required sleep threshold.
*   **Spending Logic:**
    *   **Standard Actions:** Study, Gym, Date (~1.0 - 2.0 AP).
    *   **Micro Actions:** Quick Chat, Snack, Social Media (~0.5 AP).
    *   **Constraint:** Actions are disabled if `Cost > Free AP`.
*   **Min-Maxing:**
    *   **Auto-Rest:** Unspent AP converts to extra Sleep/Recovery at the end of the turn.
    *   **Crunch:** Players can sacrifice health (Sleep) for productivity (AP).
*   **Visualization:**
    *   **The Day Bar:** A horizontal UI element showing Red (Locked), Blue (Sleep), and Green (Free) sections.
    *   **Dynamic Updates:** Clicking "Skip School" visually transforms Red segments into Green.

### UX Polish & Advanced UI
*   **Advanced Visualization:**
    *   **Agent Portrait:** A visual representation in the Left Panel based on appearance stats.
*   **Dynamic Menus:**
    *   **Responsive Design:** Support for true full-screen resizing.

### Genetics, Growth & Identity
*   **Legal Identity & Transition:**
    *   **Name Changes:** Ability to visit the courthouse to legally change First or Last name (e.g., to evade a bad reputation or after marriage).
    *   **Gender Identity:** A dedicated identity tab to socially transition (Transgender/Non-Binary) independent of medical surgery. This affects pronouns in the log and relationship reactions from conservative family members.
*   **Medical Transition Protocol:**
    *   **Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT):** A recurring medical action required for at least 3 years before Gender Reassignment Surgery becomes unlocked.
    *   **Social Consequences:** While on HRT but pre-surgery, family relationship stats fluctuate based on their "Religiousness" and "Generosity."
*   **Dietary System:**
    *   **Diet Plans:** Selectable lifestyles with monthly costs and stat impacts:
        *   *Vegan/Vegetarian:* Increases Karma/Health, slight relationship friction with certain NPCs.
        *   *Keto/Mediterranean:* High cost, boosts Health and Looks.
        *   *Junk Food/Hot Cheetos:* Low cost, rapid Health decay, increases Happiness temporarily.
    *   **Consequences:** Random events triggered by diet (e.g., "Your tapeworm cured your high blood pressure" or "You developed scurvy").
*   **Skill Mastery Mechanics:**
    *   **Practice System:** Logic to learn and level up specific skills (0-100).
    *   **Content:** Instruments, Martial Arts, Licenses (Driving, Pilot, Boating).
*   **Manual Character Creator:** UI to manually select Name, Appearance, and Attributes.
*   **Random Scenario Engine (The "Pop-up" System):**
    *   **Moral Dilemmas:** A procedural event generator that presents the player with A/B/C choices (e.g., "You found a wallet," "A bully insulted you").
    *   **Stat-Based Outcomes:** Choices are not guaranteed to succeed. Trying to "Attack" a bully calculates the winner based on the *Strength* and *Martial Arts* stats of both parties.
    *   **Karma Integration:** Decisions feed directly into the hidden Karma stat, influencing future luck.
*   **Identity Services:**
    *   **Legal Name Change:** Ability to visit the courthouse to change First or Last name (requires fee and no criminal record).
    *   **Gender Identity:** A dedicated identity tab allowing agents to socially transition (pronouns/identity) independent of medical reassignment surgery.
*   **Geopolitical Economy:**
    *   **Socialized Services:** Logic checking the `Country_ID`. If the agent is born in specific countries (e.g., UK, Canada, Norway), "Visit Doctor" and "University" actions are free (tax-funded). In others (USA), they incur high costs.
    *   **Royalty RNG:** In monarchies (Japan, UK, Saudi Arabia, etc.), a tiny RNG chance to be born into the Royal Family, overriding standard parents with Royal NPCs.

### Social Web & Relationships

    *   **Status:** Relationship bars (0-100) fluctuate based on interactions.
*   **Romance & Ex-Partners:**
    *   **Dating:** Apps, blind dates, hookups.
    *   **Partnership:** Engagement, marriage (prenups), eloping, divorce.
    *   **The "Ex" State:** Breakups move NPCs to an "Ex-Partner" list. Exes can randomly stalk the player, beg to get back together, or file restraining orders if the player persists.
    *   **Cheating:** Affairs, paternity tests, confrontation.
*   **Paternity Disputes:**
    *   **DNA Testing:** If a hookup results in pregnancy, the option to "Demand Paternity Test."
    *   **Denial:** NPCs may claim a child is yours when it isn't (or vice versa). Refusing to pay child support for a confirmed child results in automatic salary garnishment and legal trouble.
*   **Advanced Intimacy:**
    *   **Threesomes:** A rare interaction option available only if the partner has high "Craziness" (>80).
    *   **Consequences:** High risk of the partner leaving the agent for the third party, or the third party contracting an STD.
*   **Wedding Complexity:**
    *   **Venue Selection:** Choice between "Courthouse" (Cheap), "Golf Course" (Mid), or "Castle" (Expensive).
    *   **Honeymoon:** Selecting a destination affects the immediate Happiness boost and the post-wedding Relationship bar.
    *   **Prenup Logic:** If the agent is significantly richer than the fiancé, they can demand a prenup. Refusal often leads to the fiancé calling off the wedding.
*   **Reproductive Health:**

    *   **Sterilization:** Medical procedures (Vasectomy, Tubal Ligation) for 0% pregnancy chance.
    *   **STD Mechanics:** Unprotected hookups carry risks of specific diseases (Herpes, HIV, Syphilis) that drain Health until treated.
*   **Progeny:**
    *   **Reproduction:** Pregnancy, birth events, IVF, sperm donors, surrogacy, adoption.
    *   **Parenting:** Interactions affecting offspring stats; disowning children.
*   **Social Circles:** Friends, best friends, enemies, workplace cliques.
*   **Pets:** Adoption, exotic pets, interactions, veterinary health.

    *   **Parental Funding:** Interaction to "Ask for Money" with success rates based on the Relationship bar and the parents' Generosity stat.
*   **Advanced Relationship Mechanics:**
    *   **Gifting System:** Ability to purchase items from the Asset tab or specific shops (flowers, chocolates, BitLife merchandise) to gift to NPCs for massive relationship boosts.
    *   **Ex-Partners:** A persistent list of former lovers. Mechanics include "Stalking," "Rekindling," or obtaining Restraining Orders.
*   **Reproductive Health:**
    *   **Birth Control:** Toggleable options for "Safe Sex" (Condoms), hormonal birth control (The Pill), or permanent sterilization (Vasectomy/Tubal Ligation).
    *   **STD System:** Unprotected encounters carry risks of specific diseases (Herpes, HIV, Syphilis) that require medical treatment and persist until cured.
*   **Cultural & Advanced Romance:**
    *   **Arranged Marriages:** In specific cultures, parents may force an arranged marriage event at age 18+. Refusing drastically lowers the Relationship bar with parents; accepting locks the agent into a marriage with a random NPC.
    *   **Eloping:** An alternative to the "Plan Wedding" action. Costs $0 but denies the player wedding gifts/money and slightly lowers relationship with traditional parents.
    *   **Marriage Counseling:** An action available when the Spouse Relationship bar is <50%. Costs money but prevents divorce if successful. Failure accelerates divorce.
*   **School Socials:**
    *   **Classmate List:** A distinct list separate from "Friends." Allows specific interactions: "Help with Homework" (Boosts Smarts/Relationship), "Ask for Notes," or "Bully."
    *   **School Nurse:** A low-tier medical option available only during school years. Can cure minor ailments (Headache, Cold) but fails on serious diseases.
*   **Enemy Dynamics:**
    *   **The Rumble:** A specific "Attack" option for Enemies. Unlike standard assaults, this is a mutual combat event.
    *   **Lethal Force:** The ability to attempt to murder an enemy directly (without a hitman). Success depends on Strength/Weapon, but carries the highest risk of prison.

### Assets, Economy & Lifestyle

*   **Asset Maintenance & History:**
    *   **Jewelry Care:** "Clean" action to maintain asset condition and "Appraise" action to see current market value (which fluctuates independently of inflation).
*   **Renovations:**
    *   **Value Add:** "Renovate" action (e.g., Add Extension, Remodel Kitchen) costs money but increases the asset's market value beyond inflation.
    *   **Vacation Homes:** Ability to buy property in foreign countries. These do not generate rent but provide a free place to stay during "Vacation" actions.
*   **Auction Houses:**
    *   **Bidding War:** A mini-game where the agent bids against NPCs for rare jewelry or art.
    *   **Authenticity:** A hidden stat for auctioned items. An item can be bought for millions but turn out to be a "Fake" upon appraisal.
*   **Taxidermy:**
    *   **Preservation:** Upon the death of a pet (or rarely, a human relative), the option to "Taxidermy" the body.
    *   **Furniture:** The resulting item becomes a possession that can be displayed or sold (though selling human taxidermy carries legal risks).

    *   **Entry Requirements:** Joining requires specific stats (e.g., Mean Girls require 80+ Looks, Nerds require 80+ Smarts/Grades).
    *   **Benefits:** Joining a clique provides passive stat protection (e.g., Jocks don't get bullied).
*   **Workplace Politics:**
    *   **Hierarchy:** Distinguishes "Supervisor" from "Co-workers."
        *   *Supervisor:* Interactions affect job security and promotion chances. Sleeping with the boss creates a high-risk/high-reward promotion shortcut.
        *   *Co-workers:* Can be befriended or enemies.

*   **Retirement:**
    *   **Pension Logic:** After 20+ years in a career, the "Retire" option unlocks, providing a % of the salary annually until death. Quitting early forfeits this.
*   **Skill Classes:**
    *   **Voice & Acting Lessons:** Paid activities required to unlock the "Musician" or "Actor" special careers. Unlike school, these cost money per session.
    *   **Library:** A "Visit Library" action. It provides a smaller Smarts boost than "Study Hard" but is free and lowers Stress.

    *   **Campaign Manager:** Before becoming a Mayor/Governor, the agent must run a campaign.
    *   **Platform:** Player chooses a focus (Economy, Education, Environment).
    *   **Budget:** Player must allocate personal funds to the campaign. Low budget = high chance of losing the election.
    *   **Rallies:** Events where the player answers RNG questions to sway voters.
*   **Military Service Nuances:**
    *   **Rank Progression:** Enlisted vs. Officer tracks.
    *   **Medals:** Random events during deployment (e.g., "Save a squadmate") can award medals (Purple Heart, Medal of Honor). These medals are physical assets that can be sold after discharge.

*   **Specific Pathology:**
    *   **Disease Library:** Instead of generic "Sick," agents contract specific ailments (Flu, Bunions, Erectile Dysfunction, Cancer, Dementia).
    *   **Treatment Logic:** Each disease has a specific cure probability via standard medicine. Some are chronic and require annual management.
*   **Juvenile Justice:**
    *   **Juvie:** A separate incarceration system for agents under 18.
    *   **Behavior:** Good behavior in Juvie can lead to early release; bad behavior transfers the agent to adult prison upon turning 18.
*   **Legal Nuances:**
    *   **False Accusations:** Random events where the police accuse the agent of a crime they did not commit.
    *   **Lawsuits:** Ability to sue NPCs (for assault) or former employers (for wrongful termination), or be sued by them.

    *   **Reading:** "Read Book" action. Player selects a genre (Children's, Non-Fiction, Dictionary). Completing a book provides a massive Smarts boost.
    *   **Visual Media:** "Watch Documentary" (Smarts boost) vs. "Go to Movies" (Happiness boost).
    *   **Garden:** If the agent owns a house with a garden, "Tend Garden" becomes available as a high-efficiency stress reducer.

*   **Advanced Criminal Activities:**
    *   **Porch Pirate:** Stealing packages from neighbors. Low reward, low risk, but high frequency availability.
    *   **Train Robbery:** A "Time-Sensitive" crime. It is only available to attempt at specific real-world times (e.g., 4:20 PM or Midnight system time). Attempting at the wrong time results in instant death ("The train ran you over").
*   **The "Rat" System:**
    *   **Informant:** If arrested, police may offer a plea deal to become a Confidential Informant.
    *   **Mini-Game:** The agent must return to their Mafia family and "Gather Evidence" periodically without being caught.

    *   **Surrender:** A menu option to end the current life immediately (Suicide), triggering the End of Life sequence without waiting for natural death.

### Psychology, Scenarios & Genetics
*   **The "Nature vs. Nurture" Architecture:**
    *   **Genotype (The Reaction Range):** At birth, agents are not assigned a static value for Big 5 traits. Instead, they are assigned a **Genetic Range** (e.g., Extraversion Potential: 8-16). This is heavily influenced by parental heritability (approx. 40-60% correlation).
    *   **Phenotype (The Realized Self):** The current, visible attribute value. It starts at the midpoint of the Genetic Range and drifts based on environmental choices and "Core Memories."
    *   **Plasticity Curve:** The ability to change stats decreases with age.
        *   *Ages 0-6:* 100% Plasticity (Massive shifts possible).
        *   *Ages 7-18:* 50% Plasticity (Moderate shifts).
        *   *Ages 25+:* 10% Plasticity (Personality "crystallizes," requiring major trauma or effort to change).

*   **Developmental Stages & Critical Periods:**
    *   **Infancy (0-2) - Temperament:**
        *   *Focus:* **Neuroticism & Extraversion**.
        *   *Mechanic:* The "Fussiness" hidden stat. High fussiness leads to higher baseline Neuroticism (Anxiety/Vulnerability).
        *   *Parental Impact:* "Secure Attachment" events (parents responding to crying) lower Neuroticism. "Avoidant Attachment" raises it.
    *   **Early Childhood (3-6) - Impulse & Imagination:**
        *   *Focus:* **Openness & Agreeableness**.
        *   *Scenarios:* "Sharing Toys" (Altruism), "Imaginary Friend" (Fantasy), "Tantrums" (Angry Hostility).
        *   *Outcome:* Determining if the child is "Difficult" or "Easy," affecting parental relationship stress.
    *   **School Age (7-12) - Industry vs. Inferiority:**
        *   *Focus:* **Conscientiousness**.
        *   *Mechanic:* The "Homework Loop." Choices to study vs. play directly build the *Self-Discipline* and *Achievement Striving* facets.
        *   *Socialization:* First exposure to "Peer Pressure." High Agreeableness (Compliance) makes the agent susceptible to bad influences; Low Agreeableness makes them a potential bully.
    *   **Adolescence (13-19) - Identity vs. Confusion:**
        *   *Focus:* **The Volatility Spike**.
        *   *Puberty Modifier:* Between ages 13-15, a temporary "Hormonal" modifier is applied: +Impulsiveness, +Libido, +Angry Hostility, -Dutifulness.
        *   *Risk-Taking:* The prefrontal cortex is undeveloped. Scenarios involving drugs, reckless driving, and truancy appear frequently.
        *   *Ideological Formation:* The agent challenges parental values. High *Openness (Values)* increases the chance of rejecting the parents' Religion or Politics.

*   **Emergent Identity:**
    *   **Sexuality Spectrum (The Kinsey Scale):**
        *   *Latent Value:* Sexuality is a hidden float (0.0 to 6.0) determined at birth but invisible.
        *   *Discovery Phase (Ages 11-16):* Random "Crush" events reveal the value.
        *   *Fluidity:* High *Openness* allows for slight drifting on the scale during college years (Experimentation).
    *   **Religious Trajectory:**
        *   *Indoctrination (0-12):* Religiousness is inherited directly from parents.
        *   *Crisis of Faith (16-25):* High *Openness* or High *Neuroticism* (Tragedy) triggers events to question faith. Outcomes: "Devout," "Agnostic," or "Atheist."
    *   **Political Compass:**
        *   Derived from Big 5: High *Openness* correlates with Liberalism; High *Conscientiousness (Order)* correlates with Conservatism.

*   **The Scenario Engine (Context-Aware Events):**
    *   **Trigger Logic:** Scenarios are not random; they are pulled from a deck based on current stats.
        *   *Example:* An agent with High *Extraversion (Excitement Seeking)* will trigger "Street Racing" or "Clubbing" scenarios. An agent with High *Neuroticism* will trigger "Existential Dread" or "Jealousy" scenarios.
    *   **Moral Dilemmas:**
        *   *The Heinz Dilemma:* Complex choices with no right answer (e.g., "Steal medicine to save a dying friend?").
        *   *Impact:* These choices do not just adjust stats; they add **Flags** to the character (e.g., `Has_Criminal_Mindset`).
    *   **Core Memories (Perks/Traumas):**
        *   *Mechanic:* Critical successes or failures in scenarios create permanent modifiers.
        *   *Positive:* "Won State Championship" -> Permanent +5 Confidence (Lowers Vulnerability).
        *   *Negative:* "Caught Shoplifting" -> Permanent +5 Anxiety (Neuroticism).

*   **Psychopathology (The Extremes):**
    *   **Thresholds:** If a Big 5 trait hits 0 or 100 (sum 120), it manifests as a pathology.
        *   *Extreme Conscientiousness:* OCD tendencies (Obsessive cleaning events).
        *   *Extreme Neuroticism:* Clinical Depression or Panic Disorder.
        *   *Extreme Low Agreeableness:* Anti-Social Personality Disorder (Sociopathy).
    *   **Therapy:** Actions to mitigate these extremes, moving the stats back toward the mean.

## ⚖️ Design Philosophy & Abstractions

To maintain playability and focus on emergent storytelling, **Life-Sim** deliberately abstracts specific real-world complexities. We prioritize *decision-making* over *micromanagement*.

### 1. Biological Needs: Auto-Regulation
*   **Constraint:** We do not simulate hunger, thirst, bladder, or hygiene meters.
*   **Abstraction:** These are bundled into **Cost of Living** and **Health Decay**.
    *   If a player has money, "Food" is automatically purchased and consumed.
    *   If a player is broke, Health decays rapidly due to "Malnutrition."
    *   Hygiene is a modifier on the "Looks" stat, maintained by a "Grooming" time allocation in the schedule.

### 2. Economy: Aggregated Cash Flow
*   **Constraint:** No manual grocery shopping, utility bill payments, or tax filing.
*   **Abstraction:** Expenses are aggregated into a single **Monthly Outflow**.
    *   **Cost of Living:** Derived from location + house quality + family size.
    *   **Taxes:** Automatically deducted from salary before it hits the player's balance.
    *   **Inflation:** Applied globally to prices each year.

### 3. Social Interaction: Intent vs. Dialogue
*   **Constraint:** No branching dialogue trees for every conversation.
*   **Abstraction:** Interactions are **Intent-Based**.
    *   Player chooses an intent: *Compliment, Insult, Ask for Money, Flirt*.
    *   The engine calculates the outcome based on Stats (Smarts/Looks), Relationship Score, and RNG.
    *   We simulate the *result* of the conversation, not the conversation itself.

### 4. Geography: Node-Based Movement
*   **Constraint:** No open-world walking or driving physics.
*   **Abstraction:** The world is a collection of **Nodes** (Home, Work, Gym, Park).
    *   Travel is instant but incurs a "Commute Time" penalty in the Weekly Schedule based on the distance between nodes (e.g., moving to a suburb increases Commute hours, reducing Leisure hours).

### 5. Scope of Reality: Strictly Material
*   **Constraint:** No supernatural, paranormal, or sci-fi elements (e.g., Ghosts, Aliens, Cryptids, Hauntings).
*   **Abstraction:** The simulation is grounded in **Deterministic Realism**.
    *   Events are strictly biological, sociological, or statistical.
    *   "Luck" is a mathematical probability modifier, not a magical force.
    *   *Reasoning:* Excluding paranormal logic reduces code complexity (no need for "Exorcism" mechanics or "Ghost Encounter" RNG) and maintains a consistent, grounded tone focused on real-life simulation.

### 6. Progression: Sandbox over Gamification
*   **Constraint:** No "Achievements," "Ribbons," "Badges," or global leaderboards.
*   **Abstraction:** The focus is on **Intrinsic Motivation**.
    *   The "Goal" is defined by the player (e.g., "I want to be a billionaire" or "I want to have 10 kids"), not by a checklist provided by the engine.
    *   We avoid tracking meta-data across save files to keep the architecture modular and focused on the current agent's lifecycle.
    *   *Reasoning:* This prevents "Checklist Fatigue" and encourages players to experiment with the sandbox mechanics rather than optimizing their life solely to unlock a badge.

### 7. The "Faux-Conomy": Static vs. Dynamic
*   **Constraint:** No supply-and-demand logic, stock market simulation, or global trade physics.
*   **Abstraction:** The economy is **Reference-Based**.
    *   **Base Values:** Every item (House, Car, Diamond Ring) has a static `Base_Price` in the config files.
    *   **Multipliers:** Prices are calculated at runtime: `Base_Price * Inflation_Multiplier * Country_Cost_of_Living_Multiplier`.
    *   **Real Estate:** Housing markets do not crash or boom based on inventory. They simply follow a randomized noise curve (e.g., `Current_Value = Previous_Value * random(0.95, 1.08)`).
    *   *Reasoning:* Building a real economic engine is a separate game entirely. This system ensures prices *feel* dynamic without requiring a math degree to balance.

### 8. Legal & Medical: Stat-Check Resolution
*   **Constraint:** No mini-games for court trials, surgeries, or complex diagnosis puzzles.
*   **Abstraction:** Complex institutional interactions are resolved via **Weighted RNG Rolls**.
    *   **Justice:** The outcome of a trial is a single calculation: `(Lawyer_Cost * Lawyer_Skill) vs. (Crime_Severity * Evidence_RNG)`.
    *   **Medicine:** Curing a disease is not a treatment plan; it is a roll of `(Doctor_Competence * Money_Spent) vs. (Disease_Lethality)`.
    *   *Reasoning:* This keeps the gameplay loop fast. The player inputs resources (Money/Time), and the engine outputs a binary result (Guilty/Not Guilty, Cured/Dead).
